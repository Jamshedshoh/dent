To build the 4-in-1 app (Shop, Social-Share, Care - habit tracking and wellness, Booking Online Appointments) with the easy UX experience outlined, developers need to execute a series of tasks across frontend, backend, AI integration, and testing. Below is a structured table organizing the tasks by category, with descriptions, estimated complexity (Low, Medium, High), and priority (High, Medium, Low) to guide development. The tasks align with the UX design principles (simplicity, personalization, engagement, accessibility) and address dental care pain points (access, compliance, cost, prevention).
